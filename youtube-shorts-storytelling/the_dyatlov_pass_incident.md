## Script:

**(0-5s) Hook:**
**Visuals:** A chilling shot of snow-covered mountains, perhaps with a sense of isolation. Eerie, low hum or drone music begins.
**Narration:** Nine hikers. A remote mountain. And a mystery so bizarre, it defies explanation.

**(5-15s) The Expedition:**
**Visuals:** Footage of hikers trekking through snow. A shot of their tent being set up.
**Narration:** In February 1959, a group of nine experienced Soviet hikers, led by Igor Dyatlov, set out on an expedition in the Ural Mountains. They were prepared for the harsh conditions.

**(15-30s) The Horrific Discovery:**
**Visuals:** A rescue team approaching a damaged tent. Close-ups of the tent floor cut from the inside. Gloomy shots of the mountain landscape.
**Narration:** Days later, they failed to report back. When a search party found their campsite, the tent had been cut open from the *inside*. The hikers were missing.

**(30-45s) The Unexplained Details:**
**Visuals:** Quick cuts showing strange injuries (no soft tissue damage), hikers found in different states of undress, a mysterious radiation detection on their belongings.
**Narration:** Rescuers later found their bodies scattered down a nearby slope. Some were dressed only in underwear, others had strange internal injuries like fractured skulls and ribs, yet no external signs of struggle. One man was missing his tongue.

**(45-60s) The Lingering Questions:**
**Visuals:** The desolate mountain, a final eerie photo from the expedition, a swarm of question marks. Music intensifies then fades.
**Narration:** Hypotheses range from avalanches and hypothermia to military tests or even terrifyingly unknown creatures. The Dyatlov Pass Incident remains one of history's most chilling unsolved enigmas. What do YOU think happened?
