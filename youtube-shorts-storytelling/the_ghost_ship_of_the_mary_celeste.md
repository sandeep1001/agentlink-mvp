## Script:

**(0-5s) Hook:**
**Visuals:** Haunting footage of a ship sailing through fog or mist. Eerie, ambient music starts.
**Narration:** Imagine finding a ship at sea... sailing perfectly. But utterly empty.

**(5-15s) The Discovery:**
**Visuals:** A small boat approaching a larger, silent ship. Shots of decks and railings.
**Narration:** In 1872, that chilling scene became reality. The cargo ship Mary Celeste was found adrift and abandoned. Her sails were set, her cargo intact, her lifeboat missing.

**(15-30s) The Baffling Details:**
**Visuals:** Close-ups of a sealed captain's log, undisturbed food on a table, a life vest neatly folded.
**Narration:** But the crew? Vanished. No sign of struggle. No storm damage. The captain's log ended abruptly. Food was still on the table, suggesting a sudden, inexplicable departure.

**(30-45s) The Enduring Mystery:**
**Visuals:** Quick cuts of waves, a compass spinning wildly, a distorted map, shadowy figures.
**Narration:** Did pirates strike? Were they taken by a rogue wave? Or something far stranger? The fate of the Mary Celeste's crew remains one of the greatest maritime mysteries.

**(45-60s) Call to Action/Lingering Question:**
**Visuals:** The empty ship sailing into the horizon. Music swells then fades.
**Narration:** A ship found, but its story lost to the sea. What do YOU think happened to the crew of the Mary Celeste? Let us know below!
