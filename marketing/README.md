## ❓ FAQ

### **Do I need to use all these channels?**
No. Start with 1-2 where your audience hangs out. Reddit + HN are highest ROI for developer tools.

### **How long does this take?**
- **Prep:** 4-8 hours (polish website, create assets)
- **Launch week:** 2-3 hours/day (posting, engaging)
- **Ongoing:** 1 hour/day (respond to comments, ship updates)

### **What if I don't get traction?**
- Don't panic. Most launches are slow.
- Engage 1-on-1 with every interested person.
- Iterate based on feedback (ship v2 in a week).
- Try different channels (if Reddit fails, try Twitter).

### **Should I pay for promotion?**
Not yet. Organic first. Paid ads work better when you have:
- Clear product-market fit
- Testimonials/case studies
- Conversion funnel optimized

### **Can I edit these templates?**
YES! Please do. Make them sound like you. Authenticity > polish.
